The controller was written in C#.NET and communicated with the emulator via a CAN serial bus, using a custom protocol. The emulator was written in C, and was responsible for emulating various configurable inputs and outputs for the device under test. I gained incredible experience, worked with great people, and very much enjoyed working in a friendly and open work environment."

Mangobyte can connect to voice channels, act as a sound board, announce when people are joining/leaving the channel, get information about recently played matches of Dota 2, generate a GIF from the json blob of a dota match, and much more. Working on MangoByte has given me a deep understanding of python and an appreciation for the importance of elegance in design when interacting with a large amount of users."

My most notable contribution is probably the addition of a 'Story' tab, which creates a story of the events that occured during that match. Because the site is built to support multiple languages, the story is built using templates which can be defined per-language, allowing for grammatically correct stories in other languages."
